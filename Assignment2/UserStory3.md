<h1>User Story</h1>
As a user, I want to see which events fits my schedule and matches my personal preferences

<h2>Happy Path</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Events that do overlap with the user's schedule should be marked as overlapping</li>
    <li>Events that do not fit with user's desired weather should be marked as unpreffered</li>
</ul>

<h2>Unhappy Path</h2>
Our app would blindly recommend or suggest events that are not preferable and that would not fit user's desires.

<h3> Feature Significance: </h3>
This is important to improve the user experience. Our app should make it easy and seemless for users to quickly select events that they like.
