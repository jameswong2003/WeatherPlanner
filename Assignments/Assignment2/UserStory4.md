<h2> User Story 4: </h2>

<h4> "As a user, I want to quickly filter by the type of activity I'm interested in" <h4>

<h3> Happy Path: </h3>
 <ul>
     <li> The user can open the app and log into their profile </li>
     <li> The user can search for activities in a certain area </li>
    <li>The user can go choose one of over 2,000 categories in the Google Places API to filter their search results </li>
</ul>
  
<h3> Unhappy Path: </h3>
<ul> 
  <li> The user opens the app and logs into their profile </li>
  <li> The app doesn't recognize the user's location and therefore is unable to provide them with any information about the weather or activities to do</li>
</ul>

<h3> Feature Significance: </h3>
This feature is especially important in dense and populated locations with hundreds or thousands of activities in a relatively small area. If the user knows what they are looking to do, they should not have to manually search through activities which are of no interest to them first.
