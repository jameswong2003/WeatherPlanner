As we worked on our project, we had some shifts in our user stories / use cases. I will explain those here.

# Changes from Plan:

## User Story 1:
Initially we were going to use Facebook Oauth, however we switched to Google instead.

## User Story 2:
Instead of linking an activity to their Google Calendar as we described in this user story, each user has their own calendar within the website which they can add to.

## User Story 3:
Initially we were planning to have our calendar recommend activities to the user based on the weather. However, due to the complicated nature of this, we opted to have the app simply display the weather to the user, and the user can make decisions based on that information.

## User Story 4:
Instead of having the user filter activities by what they are interested in, we just have the Google Places API display activities under "entertainment" due to time constraints.
